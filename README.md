# PPE Detection System with YOLOv8
## Overview
The PPE Detection System utilizes YOLOv8, a robust object detection model, to identify and categorize Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in images and videos. This system aims to enhance safety measures by ensuring compliance with PPE requirements in various environments.

## Features
Real-time Object Detection: The system provides real-time detection and classification of PPE items such as hardhats, safety vests, masks, and gloves.

Customizable Training: Users can train the model on their own dataset for specific PPE requirements or scenarios.

GitHub Integration: The project is version-controlled and hosted on GitHub, allowing for collaboration and easy sharing.

## Prerequisites
GPU Availability: For optimal performance, it is recommended to run the system on a machine with a GPU. Check GPU availability using !nvidia-smi.

Ultralytics Installation: Install Ultralytics, the library required for YOLOv8, with !pip install ultralytics.

## Getting Started
Predict with Pre-trained Model: Quickly test the system using the pre-trained model. Follow instructions in the relevant section.

Train Your Model: If you have a custom dataset, train the model to recognize specific PPE items. Detailed instructions are provided for training.

Deploy to GitHub: Share your work and collaborate with others by deploying the project to GitHub. A step-by-step guide is included.

## Object Detection in Videos
For real-time object detection and classification in video streams, follow the instructions provided in the relevant section.
